# Collaborative Multi-LoRA Experts with Achievement-based Multi-Task Loss for Unified Multimodal Information Extraction

This is the **proprietary implementation** of our method: **Collaborative Multi-LoRA Experts with Achievement-based Multi-Task Loss** for **Unified Multimodal Information Extraction (UMIE)**.

> ðŸ“Œ **We will release the code as soon as possible. Stay tuned!**

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Our method introduces:

- **Collaborative Multi-LoRA Experts**  
  Leveraging multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts collaboratively across tasks and modalities.

- **Achievement-based Multi-Task Loss**  
  A novel task-balancing loss function that dynamically adjusts based on different task progress.


## ðŸ“… Code Release

The code is currently under final review and will be released soon.

> âœ… Please **watch** or **star** the repo to get notified once it's available.
